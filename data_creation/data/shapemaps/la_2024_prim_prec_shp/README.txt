## Processing Steps
Election results in Ascension, Assumption, Bossier, Caddo, East Baton Rouge, Lafourche, Rapides, St. Charles, and Terrebonne parishes all contained "alpha precincts" in which votes were split by the last name of voters. These results have been combined so the results can be joined to the precinct shapefiles.

Absentee votes and other votes recorded at the parish-level are allocated to precincts based on each precincts share of precinct-level vote in that parish for that particular candidate.

Demographic data for precincts comes from the precinct shapefile, sourced from the Louisiana Legislature redistricting office.
